# HangmanGame
This script implements a basic Hangman game using vanilla JavaScript. The user has to guess the letters of a randomly chosen word, and the game provides feedback on correct and incorrect guesses. The game ends when the user either guesses the word correctly or makes too many incorrect guesses.
